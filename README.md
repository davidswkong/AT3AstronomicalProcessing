# AT3AstronomicalProcessing
*Student Project*

This is a Windows Forms Application (C#/.NET) for recording and processing hourly neutrino interactions for a local observatory. The forms-based GUI application saves the data in an array, displays the data in a list box, and uses the text boxes and buttons for processing. The main processing functions are bubble sort (Sort), binary search (Binary), and linear search algorithms (Sequential Search).
